<h2>Early life</h2>
<p>I was born <mark>August 7 1990</mark> in <b style="color:black ;">Indianapolis Indiana</b> to <b style="color:black;">Mark</b> and <b style="color: black ;">Lori Patterson</b>. I didn't have a remarkable childhood. My family and I moved around a lot. I loved paying sports but, my family didn't have the money for me to play school sport, but that didn't stop me for finding sports out side of school. I was a natural,and at the time my dream was to be a wide receiver for the <b style="color:black ;">NFL</b>.</P>


<h2>Teenage years</h2>
<p>When I turned nine I got my first job at <i style="color:black ;">Southport Grooming</i>. I worked their on the weeknds with my mentor for ten years. I saved up enouph money to join the wrestling team for <b style="color: black">Perry Meridian High School</b>. Perry was known around the state for wrestling. I was on a top notch wrestling team, at that time I changed my prioities to somthing a little realistic; the military. Specifically the  <i style="color:black ;" text-decoration: underline;>UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS</i> and on <mark>June 27 2010</mark> I got my wish.</p>

<h2>My 20s</h2>
<p>I turned 20 while I was in bootcamp at <b style="color:black ;">MCRD (Marine Corps Recruiting depot) San Diego</b>, but I didn't let my drill instructors know, God knows what they woud have done to me if they found out. After a few years in the <i>Marines</i> I realized it wasn't for me. I was slaying bacteria and viruses more than I was slaying bodies. In addtion to constantly getting yelled at for something as stupid as having your hands in your pockets. So I did my four years and got out. The next several years were a roller coaster ride, if the roller coaster only went straight down. Went to Dive school. Got kicked out of dive school. Joined the Navy. got kicked out of the Navy. I slept in my car for a few years, finding work where I could until I fnally desided to go back to school for Computer programing.</p>

<h2> hobbies</h2>
<p>Since joining the Marine Corps I really got into fitness, I joind an <b style="color:black;"> MMA</b> gym and immersed myself into combat sports. I have a passion for <b style="color:black ;">Jujitsu</b> and pratice it regularly. But before  starting <b style="color:black ;">MMA</b> I fell in love with <b style="color:black ;">Calithenics/Gymnastics</b>. I loved the skill aspeect of gymnastics. It was more complex than just pick up somthing heavy and put it back down, and there was a lot of skill transfer over to <b style="color:black ;">Jujitsu</b>.</p>
